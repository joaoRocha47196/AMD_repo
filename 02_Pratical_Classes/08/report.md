## 2. - How to “learn a codebook”, for 1Epoch, using the LVQ method?

- Consider the file: “LVQ_algorithm_exercise.xlsx”. Note: the data is the same as in slides. 
    - Open the “LVQ_algorithm_exercise.xlsx” and explore the “LVQ_1Epoch.xlsx” sheet. 
    - Analyze the “Dataset” and the “Codebook Vectors”; identify each point plotted in the graphs. 
    - Move to the “Training” part of the sheet and analyze the data that is already filled. 
    - Fill the first row (of the “Training” part) with the formulations indicated in each column. Whenever the first row is corrected implemented the “CHECK (oneEpoch)” value of “notOk” will turn into “ok” (for that first row). 
    - Follow the previous reasoning and fill the cells of the first 4 rows. Whenever the corresponding indication turns into “ok” fill the next 4 rows (so, by now all first 8 rows are correctly implemented!) 
    - Extend the previous reasoning to implement the training for a whole epoch (the first epoch). Make sure that all rows get the “ok” mark! 
    - Make sure that the “CHECK (codebook-afterOneEpoch”) is all marked with the “ok” tag. Now you have a solid understanding of the “mechanics” behind the implementation of the LVQ method.
