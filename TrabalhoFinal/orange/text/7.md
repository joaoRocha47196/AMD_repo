Although I cannot create a deployable solution in this context, I can guide you through creating a simplistic model using Python and the 1R algorithm. This method will predict the `lenses` type based on your data provided in the `view_export.csv` file and generate a model that could be deployed.

### Step 1: Implementing the 1R Algorithm
You can find the initial implementation in the previous messages. Essentially, the 1R algorithm identifies the feature that, when generating rules solely based on it, yields the highest accuracy for a categorical target variable. You can use the implementation provided in previous messages to identify the rules generated by the 1R algorithm.

### Step 2: Implementing the OneRClassifier Class
As outlined earlier, the `OneRClassifier` class will use the rules derived from the 1R algorithm to classify new instances. It requires an understanding of the Orange data mining framework to integrate with it, though. Be sure to adjust the predictor to fit into your Orange data mining workflow.

### Step 3: Training the Model
Utilize your `view_export.csv` dataset to find the most accurate rules with the 1R algorithm. Implement these rules in the `OneRClassifier`, which uses them to predict the `lenses` type for new data instances.

```python
# Using the previously defined oneR() function and OneRClassifier class...

# Load your data
data = load_data('view_export.csv')

# Find the rules using 1R
feature, rules = oneR(data)

# Assume domain and data_obj are Orange.data.Table object of your dataset
# (you need to create this based on your data).

classifier = OneRClassifier(feature=feature, rules=rules, domain=data_obj.domain)
```

### Step 4: Deploying the Model
Deployment can be achieved in several ways, for example, through a web API using Flask or FastAPI, or by integrating it into an application or system. Regardless of the deployment strategy, your model needs to be saved first. You might use Pythonâ€™s `pickle` library to do so.

```python
import pickle

# Save the model
with open('oneR_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(classifier, file)
```
To deploy:
- **Via Web API**: Use Flask/FastAPI to create an API that takes input data, uses the classifier to make predictions, and then returns the predictions.
- **Integrated into a System**: Implement the classifier into your existing systems, ensuring it can receive the input data, make predictions, and utilize them as needed.

### Step 5: Utilizing the Model
Whenever you need to make a prediction:
- Load the model.
- Provide the new data instance.
- Use the model to predict the `lenses` type.
- Utilize the prediction in your desired manner.

```python
# Load the model
with open('oneR_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Predict new instances
# new_data should be preprocessed in the same manner as the training data
predictions = model.predict(new_data)
```

### Final Note
This is a fundamental and very high-level solution. Real-world scenarios would require more robust solutions, data validation, preprocessing, error handling, logging, and potentially a user interface or API for interaction. Always ensure that your solution is thoroughly tested and validated before deploying it into a production environment.
