Creating a simple 1R classifier and integrating it into the Orange framework can be broken down into several steps. First, let's write a simple 1R classifier using Python. The 1R (One Rule) algorithm is quite straightforward and creates a rule based on the feature that shows the best performance (e.g., the highest accuracy) when predicting the class variable. 

### 1R Classifier Implementation

```python
import csv
from collections import defaultdict
import Orange

def load_data(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        data = [row for row in reader]
    return data

def oneR(data):
    headers = data[0]
    data = data[1:]
    min_error_feature = None
    min_error = float("inf")
    best_rules = {}
    
    for feature_idx in range(len(headers) - 1):  # Excluding the class variable
        # Counting how many times a feature value and class value occur together
        freq_table = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
        
        for row in data:
            feature_value = row[feature_idx]
            class_value = row[-1]
            freq_table[feature_value][class_value] += 1
        
        # Finding the most frequent class for each feature value
        rules = {}
        feature_error = 0
        for feature_value, class_counts in freq_table.items():
            most_common_class = max(class_counts, key=class_counts.get)
            rules[feature_value] = most_common_class
            feature_error += sum(count for class_value, count in class_counts.items() if class_value != most_common_class)
        
        # Updating the best rule if this feature has fewer errors
        if feature_error < min_error:
            min_error = feature_error
            min_error_feature = headers[feature_idx]
            best_rules = rules
            
    print(f"Best 1R feature: {min_error_feature}")
    print(f"Rules: {best_rules}")
    return min_error_feature, best_rules

data = load_data('view_export.csv')
feature, rules = oneR(data)
```
### Integration with Orange

Integration with Orange and model deployment are somewhat complex. Below is a high-level idea of how it might be done. Note that this doesn't work directly and is more of a guide.

```python
import Orange

class OneRClassifier(Orange.classification.Model):
    def __init__(self, feature, rules):
        self.feature = feature
        self.rules = rules
        
    def predict(self, X):
        res = []
        feature_index = domain.index(self.feature)
        for instance in X:
            feature_value = instance[feature_index]
            predicted_class = self.rules.get(feature_value, None)
            if predicted_class is not None:
                res.append(predicted_class)
            else:
                res.append('?')  # Handling unknown values
        return res

# Further steps would involve:
# - Creating a Learner class that returns instances of the above Model class.
# - Fitting the model on your data.
# - Saving the model in a format that can be deployed (e.g., using pickle).
```

This sample code will not run directly and needs to be integrated into a fully working Orange-based model and workflow. Full integration and deployment would require handling data input/output, various error handling, additional functionality, and potentially a user interface - which is beyond the scope of a single message.

Use this as a starting point and build upon it according to your project needs. If you have specific questions or run into issues, feel free to ask for further guidance.
