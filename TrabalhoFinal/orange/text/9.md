To provide a thorough evaluation of the models (1R, ID3, and Naïve Bayes) developed for "MedKnow," we can focus on several critical areas such as accuracy, interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability. Below is a generalized assessment and recommendation. For actual advice, empirical data from model evaluations (e.g., cross-validation, confusion matrices, ROC curves) would be needed.

### 1. 1R Algorithm:
**Pros:**
- **Simplicity:** Extremely easy to understand and interpret.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Requires very little computational power.

**Cons:**
- **Accuracy:** Generally, it's not the most accurate method because it oversimplifies the problem.

### 2. ID3 Algorithm:
**Pros:**
- **Interpretability:** Decision trees (like ID3) are relatively easy to interpret and visualize.
- **Handle Different Types of Variables:** Can manage numerical and categorical data.

**Cons:**
- **Overfitting:** Tends to overfit, especially when a tree is particularly deep.
- **Biased to Dominant Class:** May be biased towards the dominant class.

### 3. Naïve Bayes:
**Pros:**
- **Scalability:** Performs well with high-dimensional data.
- **Computational Efficiency:** Requires comparatively less computational power.
  
**Cons:**
- **Assumption of Independence:** Assumes all features are independent, which might not be the case.
- **Data Scarcity:** Probability estimation can be inaccurate if data for a particular class label is scarce.

### Evaluation:
- **Accuracy:** Depending on your data, one model may have a considerably higher accuracy and F1 Score than the others.
- **Speed:** Consider not only the speed of prediction but also the time taken to train the model.
- **Scalability:** Evaluate how well the model can be adapted or retrained as more data becomes available.
  
### Conclusions & Recommendations:

#### For “MedKnow”:

1. **If interpretability is paramount:** ID3 might be the best choice because of its straightforward interpretability.
   
2. **If prediction accuracy is paramount:**
   - **Naïve Bayes:** Could be a good option if you have a large number of features and the independence assumption holds true in practice.
   - **1R:** Might fall short in this regard due to its simplicity and tendency to oversimplify the problem.

3. **For scalability and efficiency:**
   - **Naïve Bayes** usually excels in scenarios where computational efficiency and scalability are crucial.

4. **If simplicity and ease of understanding are crucial:** 1R is the simplest model, albeit potentially at the cost of predictive accuracy.

### Note:
Actual model performance must be validated using your specific dataset. Cross-validation results (precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy) must guide the final decision in selecting the model. Furthermore, it is wise to explore ensemble methods, which might combine the strengths of different algorithms to potentially deliver superior performance.

### Final Suggestion:
Given the medical context, it's crucial to optimize for metrics that minimize false negatives or false positives, depending on the use-case's sensitivity. Ensure that the chosen model aligns with the specific needs and constraints of “MedKnow” while also being mindful of ethical considerations and potential biases in the models. Always adhere to relevant legal and ethical guidelines, such as GDPR and HIPAA, especially when dealing with medical data.
