Creating a deployable model for "MedKnow" with ID3 and Naïve Bayes approaches can be accomplished through a general set of steps:

### Step 1: Preprocessing the Data
- **Loading the Data**: Ensure that your dataset is in a format that is suitable for your machine learning library (e.g., Orange or scikit-learn).
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing or anomalous values.
- **Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into a format suitable for your machine learning algorithm.

### Step 2: Model Development
#### ID3 Model
For ID3, we will build a decision tree model.

```python
import Orange

# Assume `data` is an Orange.data.Table object of your dataset.
# Set your classifier
id3_classifier = Orange.classification.TreeLearner(data, criterion="entropy")

# To make predictions
# predictions = Orange.evaluation.testing.TestOnTestData(data, test_data, [lambda testdata: id3_classifier])
```

#### Naïve Bayes Model
Naïve Bayes classifier can be implemented using Orange or scikit-learn.

With Orange:

```python
nb_classifier = Orange.classification.NaiveBayesLearner(data)

# To make predictions
# predictions = Orange.evaluation.testing.TestOnTestData(data, test_data, [lambda testdata: nb_classifier])
```

### Step 3: Model Evaluation
Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness.

```python
# With Orange, you can use evaluation methods
results = Orange.evaluation.testing.cross_validation([id3_classifier, nb_classifier], data, k=10)
```

### Step 4: Deploying the Model
Save and deploy your model in an accessible manner for your use case. 

#### Saving the Models

```python
import pickle

# Save models
with open('id3_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(id3_classifier, file)

with open('nb_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(nb_classifier, file)
```

#### Deploy via Web API (using Flask)

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load models
with open('id3_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    id3_model = pickle.load(file)

with open('nb_model.pkl', 'rb') as file:
    nb_model = pickle.load(file)

@app.route('/predict_id3', methods=['POST'])
def predict_id3():
    input_data = request.get_json()
    # Ensure data is processed & formatted as per model requirements
    # prediction = id3_model(input_data)
    return jsonify(prediction)

@app.route('/predict_nb', methods=['POST'])
def predict_nb():
    input_data = request.get_json()
    # Ensure data is processed & formatted as per model requirements
    # prediction = nb_model(input_data)
    return jsonify(prediction)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(port=5000)
```

### Final Thoughts:
- Always validate and verify your models with unseen data.
- Be mindful of the ethical considerations, ensure the model is interpretable, and its decisions can be explained.
- Maintain and monitor the model regularly once deployed, ensuring it adapts to any changes or drifts in the data.

These steps provide a high-level guideline for building and deploying ID3 and Naïve Bayes models for “MedKnow”. In practical terms, each step might need to be significantly elaborated upon, considering the specificities and complexities of the real-world data and use-case.
